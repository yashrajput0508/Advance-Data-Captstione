# Online Shopper Intention Prediction


![](https://github.com/NikhilDange1/IBM-Capstone/blob/master/ppt/online_browsing.jpg)

This repository is a Data Science project implementation for IBM Advanced Data science certification on coursera. The goal of the project is to explain what actions of   customer browsing on a e-commerce website will contribute to that customer buying a product. The Online shopper intention Dataset found on Kaggle and also on UCI repository was used. This Dataset was collected from the Turkish website for Columbia clothing brand. 

The project can be divided into three parts. 
1. Explanatory Data analysis 
2. Extract load transform 
3. Model training and tuning 

Since the main goal of this project is to explain the user actions that contribute to website revenue the main algorithm used is a Gradient boosted decision tree implemented using LightGBM. Additionally, a Neural Network is used as a Reference for how good/bad the original model performs. 

Below the organization of the files are explained
